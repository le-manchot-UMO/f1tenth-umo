# Safety watchdog for an UNATTENDED exploration run.
#
#   run_watchdog.sh [max_minutes] [min_volts]     defaults 25 min, 10.5 V
#
# Exists because an out-of-range run cannot be stopped remotely, and this car has
# no joystick connected, so the mux e-stop is unavailable. It stops the run and
# commands the car to zero on any of:
#
#   * battery below min_volts  (3S LiPo; 10.5 V is 3.5 V/cell. Going under
#     ~3.0 V/cell permanently damages cells, and a sagging pack is what drops
#     the VESC off USB mid-run, leaving the car driving with no steering)
#   * max_minutes elapsed
#   * the VESC disappearing from /dev  (cable came loose — the car would
#     otherwise keep its last commanded speed with no way to steer)
#
# Writes /tmp/watchdog.log so the reason is recoverable afterwards.
