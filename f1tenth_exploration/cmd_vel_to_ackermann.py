"""Bridge Nav2's /cmd_vel (Twist) to the car's /drive (AckermannDriveStamped).

Nav2 speaks the differential-drive language of linear.x + angular.z. The car
steers, so angular velocity has to become a steering angle through the bicycle
model:

    delta = atan(wheelbase * omega / v)

This node also publishes CONTINUOUSLY at `publish_rate`, holding the last
command, rather than only on each /cmd_vel. That is deliberate and does three
jobs at once:

  1. Primes odometry. vesc_to_odom only emits /odom and the odom->base_link TF
     while servo commands are flowing, because it integrates the commanded
     servo position. With nothing on /drive the whole chain goes quiet, the TF
     disappears, and Nav2's costmaps come up blind — no TF means no scan
     raytracing, which means no obstacles, which means the car drives into
     walls. Publishing a stationary command from startup keeps the TF alive
     before Nav2 has said anything. (This replaces the older separate
     prime_odom.py, which raced the bridge for ownership of /drive.)

  2. Feeds the mux. ackermann_mux drops an input that goes silent for 0.2 s.

  3. Acts as a watchdog. If Nav2 stops publishing (crash, killed node, goal
     cancelled), commands go stale after `cmd_timeout` and this node commands
     zero speed. Without that the VESC would happily hold the last non-zero
     speed forever and the car would drive away on its own.

Steering limits come from the servo calibration in vesc.yaml:
    servo = -1.2135 * delta + 0.5304,  servo clamped to [0.15, 0.85]
which yields a usable steering range of about -0.263 .. +0.313 rad. The default
max_steering_angle of 0.26 rad is the symmetric limit inside that range, giving
a minimum turning radius of wheelbase / tan(0.26) ~= 0.94 m.
